# Bhavanavishkar - Speech Emotion Recognition
   Human and machine interaction is an area where computer science is looking forward in various new upcoming technologies and taking them to the next advance level. Speech Emotion Recognition contribute in grater extent in this field. As the speech produces by humans helps us to understand and predict what is the certain emotion of a human being in a particular situation and thus can be developed.

# Why Emotion   
  Emotion awareness improves customer experience. Which helps us to predict what exact feedback a customer has on a particular product what are the various problems, difficulties he/she faced. This will lead is better designing of a product and carrying out it in an efficient and effective manner.

This has lead building of Human Computer interface to a next level where computers/machines can exactly understand the  real time  emotion state of a person and can handle the different programs accordingly and this eventually makes a better customer experience.
  
  On the same root, if a machine knowns the exact emotion state of a student then by assessing those emotions it can present the perfect match to a student maybe it be in notes, videos, slides, etc format which will create a fruitful Computer Aid Learning Technology which is the exact need in this pandemic situation.
